# Unity Project Template

Folder structure as of 16/03/2022.  
This is updated with 2020.3.30f1 LTS, but the folder structure will work on all versions.  
All folders include a small .gitkeep file in case GitHub wants to delete empty folders, all of these can be deleted whenever, but I recommend that you have a .gitkeep file in all your empty folders here on GitHub in the future.  
Enjoy!
